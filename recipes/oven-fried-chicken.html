        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p>
        <p>Cut down on oil by making "fried" chicken in the oven. This oven-fried chicken recipe, made with simple ingredients you probably already have on hand, is as good as it gets.</p>

            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Â½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

            <li>Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat eggs in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Dredge chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, until all pieces are coated.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs and sprinkle with paprika to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.</li>
